*[maxima-jupyter][maxima-jupyter] with additions*

[![][logo]][logo-large]

## Features

This project provides the following additional features on top of the excellent
[maxima-jupyter][maxima-jupyter] project:

* A Common Lisp kernel along with the Maxima and Python kernels
* Dark-themed notebook support
* LaTeX install for PDF-download support from running notebooks (PDF files are 
  formatted as standard technical/research articles)
* Inkscape (SVG, PDF support)
* A "polyglot" image that contains Jupyter notebook support for Python,
  Maxima, Common Lisp, Clojure, and Go kernels

Forthcoming features may be viewed here: 
* https://github.com/calyau/maxima-jupyter-plus/issues

Note that the use of Arch Linux in these images was due to its use in the 
maxima-jupyter project's `Dockerfile`.

## Catalog of Docker Images

The following images generated by this project are available on Docker Hub
(sizes are also given, with compressed sizes in parentheses):

* [calyau/maxima-jupyter-latex][maxima-jupyter-latex] - 5.12 GB (1.52 GB)
* [calyau/maxima-jupyter-dark][maxima-jupyter-dark] - 3.85 GB (1.17 GB)
* [calyau/maxima-jupyter-dark-latex][maxima-jupyter-dark-latex] - 5.36 GB (1.6 GB)
* [calyau/maxima-jupyter-cl][maxima-jupyter-cl] - 2.04 GB (638.66 MB)
* [calyau/maxima-jupyter-polyglot][maxima-jupyter-polyglot] - 4.92 GB (1.65 GB)
* [calyau/maxima-jupyter-polyglot-latex][maxima-jupyter-polyglot-latex] - 6.33 GB (2.04 GB)
* [calyau/maxima-jupyter-polyglot-dark-latex][maxima-jupyter-polyglot-dark-latex] - 6.53 GB (2.1 GB)

Note that the Docker image for the standard `maxima-jupyter` weighs in at
~2 GB.

## Usage

### Running

Run with LaTeX support:

```shell
docker run -it \
    -p 8888:8888 \
    calyau/maxima-jupyter-latex:latest \
    notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888
```

Run with dark theme support:

```shell
docker run -it \
    -p 8888:8888 \
    calyau/maxima-jupyter-dark:latest \
    notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888
```

Run with dark theme + latex support:

```shell
docker run -it \
    -p 8888:8888 \
    calyau/maxima-jupyter-dark-latex:latest \
    notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888
```

Run with Common Lisp (SBCL), Maxima, and Python kernels:

```shell
docker run -it \
    -p 8888:8888 \
    calyau/maxima-jupyter-cl:latest \
    notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888
```

Run with Common Lisp (SBCL), Maxima, Clojure, Go, and Python kernels:

```shell
docker run -it \
    -p 8888:8888 \
    calyau/maxima-jupyter-polyglot:latest \
    notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888
```

Same as previous, but with LaTeX support:

```shell
docker run -it \
    -p 8888:8888 \
    calyau/maxima-jupyter-polyglot-latex:latest \
    notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888
```

Same as previous, but with the dark theme:

```shell
docker run -it \
    -p 8888:8888 \
    calyau/maxima-jupyter-polyglot-dark-latex:latest \
    notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888
```

### Overrides

To run these kernels against your own notebooks directory, you can use
a command like this for start-up:

```shell
docker run -it \
    -v `pwd`/notebooks:/home/oubiwann/maxima-jupyter/examples \
    -p 8888:8888 \
    calyau/maxima-jupyter-latex:latest \
    notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888
```

If port `8888` is in use on your system, you can change the port used by
Docker with a command like this following:

```shell
docker run -it \
    -p 9999:8888 \
    calyau/maxima-jupyter-latex:latest \
    notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888
```

## Notes

### Docker Images Sizes

The images generated by this repo are very large, due to the additional
dependencies that are pulled in. As such, these images are not intended for
general use, but rather for the special cases where Docker image size is
a secondary concern to the primary needs addressed by the additional 
features.

### LaTeX Support

When creating aligned equations in Markdown text, be careful: MathJAX (used by
Jupyter for web-based LaTeX support) adds LaTeX and this can cause Pandoc to
exit with an error when attempting to download a PDF of the notebook. In 
particular, it is recommended that aligned equations be declared in the 
Markdown cells as the following:

```latex
$$\begin{split}
\frac {d x}{d t} & = s(y - x) \\
\frac {d y}{d t} & = rx - y - xz \\
\frac {d x}{d t} & = xy - bz \\
\end{split}$$
```

Note the absence of `{align}` or `{equation}` blocks.
